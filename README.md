# ðŸŽ® Shotgun Hero  
*A 2D platformer where movement is driven by shotgun recoil physics!*  

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Recoil-Based Movement**: Every shot pushes you backward with realistic physics.  
- **Limited Ammo**: 2-shot capacity with auto-reloading.  
- **Mouse Aiming**: Shotgun rotates toward cursor position.  
- **5 Unique Floors**: Vertical progression with collision detection.  

## ðŸš€ How to Play

   - **R**: Reload (when grounded)  
   - **Mouse**: Aim  

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes  
- Built with vanilla JavaScript (no engines)  
- Custom physics system for recoil (`Player.js`)
